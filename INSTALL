INTRODUCTION
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this document we explain how to install MySQL Connector/ODBC.
This document does not describe platform specific details - see
INSTALL.<platform> for details on your specific platform.

REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------

Platforms

        Binary Distributions

                * MS Windows 2000 or newer 
                * Solaris 8 or newer
                * OSX 10.3 or newer
                * Linux (SuSE 10 or compatible)
                * HPUX
        
        Source Distributions
                
                Connector/ODBC is designed to be portable and can be 
                built for a wide variety of platforms without any 
                changes or, in some cases, with minor changes.

ODBC Systems

        Strictly speaking, the driver can be used without any ODBC system
        but in practice this is seldom done. Depending upon your 
        system - one of the following is needed and is usually 
        available with your operating system (and is often installed
        by default).

                * unixODBC
                * Apple iODBC
                * iODBC
                * Microsoft ODBC

DISTRIBUTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------

You will need either a source or binary distribution which is 
compatible with your platform (machine and operating system). 
Various types of distributions are available. Some distribution
types are not supported on some platforms. See downloads at
www.mysql.com.

Binary With Installer

        This is the recommended distribution type. 
        
        Some platforms have package systems which manage the 
        install and uninstall of software packages.
        
        MS Windows      - msi or setup.exe
        Solaris         - pkg
        OSX             - pkg
        Linux           - rpm

        See INSTALL.<platform> for details on how to install
        and uninstall a package and any special considerations
        for doing so.

Binary Without Installer

        Some platforms do not have a commonly accepted package
        system or for some other reason we have elected not to
        support it. In this case we provide a binary without
        any installer. This may also be useful for those 
        wishing more control over the install process.

        This is either provided as;

        MS Windows      - zip
        Linux           - source rpm, tar-ball
        others          - tar-ball

Source With Installer

        We provide a source distribution with installer on one
        platform, linux, as this is common practice on rpm based
        linux platforms.

Source Without Installer

        We provide source distributions which can be built on
        a variety of platforms. Source distributions are 
        derived from the source repository but is cleaned up
        to make using it easier. This type of distributions is
        as;

        MS Windows      - zip
        others          - tar-ball

Source Repository

        The source repository has been bitkeeper (bk) in the past
        and this had read-only public access. The new source
        code repository is subversion (svn) and is, currently, 
        just for MySQL internal use.


INSTALLING
---------------------------------------------------------------

Connector/ODBC is installed by doing the following steps;

1. copy the driver to the system
2. register the driver with systems ODBC (possibly with myodbc3i)

Binary With Installer

        Both install steps are done for you when you use a binary 
        distribution which includes an installer. See 
        INSTALL.<platform> for details.

Binary Without Installer

        In this case one must first extract the files and then 
        manually copy the files to a desired location and then
        manually register the driver with the ODBC system. 

        In some cases there may be install/uninstall scripts to 
        aid in this process. See INSTALL.<platform> for details.

Source

        In this case one must first build the driver and programs
        and then install them. The install is the same as
        'Binary Without Installer' except there is no need to 
        extract files as they will be in place after a build.
