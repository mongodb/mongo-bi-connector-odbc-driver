5.1.6 (09-Nov-2009)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * Providing an empty string as the catalog argument to SQLTables()
    will return an empty result set. A catalog must have a name.
  * Remove use of "old" SQLLEN/SQLULEN types aliases. They are not

    arguments that could be overrun, and misinterpreted some arguments
    as patterns when they should be treated as identifiers. (Bug #36275)
  * SQLDriverConnect() returned SQL_ERROR when the user cancelled
    the dialog box instead of SQL_NO_DATA. (Bug #36293)

  * SQLForeignKeys returned an empty string for the schema columns instead of
    a NULL. (Bug #19923)
  * SQLGetInfo() reported characters for SQL_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS that were
    not encoded correctly. (Bug #33130)
  * Adding or updating a row using SQLSetPos() on a result set with aliased
    columns would fail. (Bug #6157)
  * Changing the DSN name when editing a DSN left behind the DSN
    under the old name in addition to creating the new entry. Fixed for
    native Windows GUI. (Bug #31165, fixed for Qt GUI in 3.51.23)
  * Numeric values (such as OPTIONS or PORT) were not read correctly
    from a connection string if they were not the last parameter. (Bug #33822)

  * Added MSI installer for Windows 64-bit. (Bug #31510)
  * Implemented support for SQLCancel(). (Bug #15601)
  * Added wrappers for missing ODBC driver manager installer functions.
    This makes it possible to use the driver with unixODBC 2.2.11, which
    is the version shipped with Debian and Ubuntu. (Bug #32685)
  * Disallow 'SET NAMES' in initial statement and in executed statements.
  * Replaced the internal library which handles creation and loading
    of DSN information. The new library, which was originally a part of
    Connector/ODBC 5.0, supports Unicode option values.
  * Implemented native Windows setup library.
  * Removed monitor (myodbc3m) and dsn-editor (myodbc3c).
  * Replaced myodbc3i (now myodbc-installer) with Connector/ODBC 5.0
    version.

    now always built against the threadsafe version of libmysql.

  Bugs fixed:
  * SQL statements were limited to 64k. (Bug #30983)
  * Diagnostics were not correctly cleared on connection and
    environment handles.
  * SQLCopyDesc() did not correctly copy all records.
  * Freeing a statement resulted in a memory leak due to descriptor
    records not being freed. (Bug #31115)

    statement execution. (Bug #29239)
  * ADO could not open a recordset that has a DECIMAL field (Bug #31720)
  * SQLError() incorrectly cleared the error information, making it
    unavailable from subsequent calls to SQLGetDiagRec().
  * ADO was unable to open record set using dynamic cursor. (Bug #32014)
  * SQLSetConnectAttr() did not clear previous errors, possibly confusing
    SQLError().
  * SQLDescribeColW returned UTF-8 column as SQL_VARCHAR instead of
    SQL_WVARCHAR. (Bug #32161)
  * Fixed SQL_ATTR_PARAM_BIND_OFFSET, and fixed row offsets to work
    with updatable cursors.
  * SQLSetPos w/SQL_DELETE advances dynamic cursor incorrectly. (Bug #29765)

  * Changing the DSN name when editing a DSN left behind the DSN
    under the old name in addition to creating the new entry. (Bug #31165)

----

3.51.22 (13-Nov-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * Removed workaround for bug #10491 in the server, which has now been
    fixed in MySQL Server 5.0.48 and 5.1.21.
  * Added FLAG_COLUMN_SIZE_S32 to limit the reported column size to a
    signed 32-bit integer. This option is automatically enabled for ADO
    applications, in order to work around a bug in ADO. (Bug #13776)

  Bugs fixed:
  * SQLGetInfo() reported that UNION was not supported. (Bug #32253)
  * The non-portable "English" locale was used for handling of decimal

----

3.51.21 (5-Oct-2007)

  Bugs fixed:
  * The wrong value was returned for SQL_DESC_LITERAL_PREFIX and

  * The wrong SQLSTATE was reported when the connection to the server
    was lost. (Bug #3456)
  * SQLDescribeCol() incorrectly reported whether auto-increment and
    some timestamp fields were nullable. (Bug #26108)
  * SQLGetTypeInfo() reported the wrong column size for the SQL_TYPE_TIME
    type. (Bug #30939)
  * Empty selection for database and character set comboboxes in setup

    mapping of deprecated functions (buffer length -1). (Bug#29871)
  * SQLGetConnectAttr() did not reflect the connection state correctly.
    (Bug#14639)

----

3.51.19 (8-Aug-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * Because of Bug #10491 in the server, character string results were
    sometimes incorrectly identified as SQL_VARBINARY. Until this server
    bug is corrected, the driver will identify all variable-length
    strings as SQL_VARCHAR.

----

3.51.18 (6-Aug-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * An experimental binary package, without an installer, is available
    for Microsoft Windows x64 Edition.
  * Binary packages as disk images with installers are now available
    for Mac OS X.
  * Binary packages for Sun Solaris are available as PKG packages.
  * Added FLAG_MULTI_STATEMENTS to allow issuing queries that contain
    multiple statements. Also added to the setup GUI. (Bug #7445)
  * Removed support for the TRACE and TRACEFILE DSN options. The standard
    ODBC logging should be used.
  * Added support for SQL_ATTR_ROW_BIND_OFFSET_PTR in normal cursors.
    (Bug #6741)
  * Added SSL options to the GUI setup dialog.

  Bugs fixed:
  * SQLColumns() incorrectly reported that an auto-incrementing
    field was not nullable. (Bug #14407)
  * SQLColumns() incorrectly reported that an auto-updating timestamp
    field was not nullable. (Bug #14414)
  * Lengths returned by SQLColumns(), SQLDescribeCol(), and SQLColAttribute()
    were often incorrect. These lengths should now conform to the ODBC
    specification. FLAG_FIELD_LENGTH no longer has any effect. The default
    behavior was incorrect. (Bug #27862)
  * The SQL_DATA_TYPE column in SQLColumns() results did not report the
    correct value for date and time types.
  * The SQL_DATETIME_SUB column in SQLColumns() was not correctly set for
    date and time types.
  * The value for SQL_DESC_FIXED_PREC_SCALE was not returned correctly
    for decimal values in MySQL 5.0 and later.
  * The wrong value from SQL_DESC_LITERAL_SUFFIX was returned for binary
    fields.
  * The wrong value for SQL_DESC_TYPE was returned for date and time types.
  * The wrong value for DECIMAL_DIGITS in SQLColumns() was reported for
    FLOAT and DOUBLE fields, as well as the wrong value for the scale
    parameter to SQLDescribeCol(), and the SQL_DESC_SCALE attribute
    from SQLColAttribute().
  * MySQL BIT(n) fields were always treated as SQL_BIT data. When n > 1,
    they are now treated as binary data.
  * If the connection character set was set to a multibyte character set,
    such as UTF-8, the wrong column size was reported. (Bug #19345)
  * SQLSpecialColumns() returned all TIMESTAMP fields when queried for
    SQL_ROWVER, not just an auto-updating TIMESTAMP field. (Bug #9927, still
    limited by Bug #30081 in the server.)
  * SQLConnect() and SQLDriverConnect() were rewritten to eliminate duplicate
    code and ensure all options were supported using both connection methods.
    SQLDriverConnect() now only requires the setup library to be present when
    the call requires it.
  * SQLColumns() failed when a catalog was specified due to an
    incorrectly-generated query. (Bug #29888)
  * SQLGetTypeInfo() returned incorrect information for date and time
    fields, and would not return results when queried for the SQL_DATETIME
    type. (Bug #28657)
  * myodbc3i did not honor the 's' and 'u' modifier to the -d option for
    installing the driver as a system or user driver. (Bug #29964)
  * Tables from the mysql database (catalog) were listed as SYSTEM TABLES
    by SQLTables() even when a different catalog was being queried. This
    also introduced errors due to the fix for Bug #26934.  (Bug #28662)

----

3.51.17 (13-Jul-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * The setup library has been split into its own RPM package, to allow
    installing the driver itself with no GUI dependencies.
  * Added an option (CHARSET) for specifying the default character
    set for a connection. This must be used instead of a "SET NAMES"
    statement. Also available from the GUI setup dialog. (Related
    to Bug #6667 and Bug #9498.)
  * Dis-allow NULL ptr for null indicator when calling SQLGetData()
    if value is null. Now returns SQL_ERROR w/state 22002.
  * Fixed calling convention ptr and wrong free in myodbc3i, and fixed
    the null terminating (was only one, not two) when writing DSN to string.

  Bugs fixed:
  * myodbc3i did not correctly format driver info, which could cause the
    installation to fail. (Bug #29709)
  * Multiple result sets were not correctly flushed when a statement
    handle was closed. (Bug #16817)
  * SQLProcedures() did not handle NULL parameters, which could lead to
    crashes (Bug #28316)
  * SQLColumns() did not handle many of its parameters correctly, which
    could lead to incorrect results. The table name argument was not handled
    as a pattern value, and most arguments were not escaped correctly when
    they contained non-alphanumeric characters. (Bug #8860)
  * If there was more than one unique key on a table, the correct fields
    were not used in handling SQLSetPos(). (Bug #10563)
  * SQLColAttribute() returned the wrong value for SQL_DESC_BASE_COLUMN_NAME
    and SQL_DESC_BASE_TABLE_NAME for aliased fields. (Bug #6197)
  * Calling SQLGetDiagField with RecNumber 0,DiagIdentifier
    NOT 0 returns SQL_ERROR (Bug #16224)
  * Correctly return error if SQLBindCol is called with an invalid column
  * Fixed error handling of OOM and bad connections in catalog functions.
    This might raise errors in code paths that had not seen them in the past.
    Gathered the logic for internal result sets into one place. (Bug #26934)
  * Fixed bad use of memory related to setup/util/GUI. (Bug #27315)
  * Added a new DSN "OPTION" (FLAG_ZERO_DATE_TO_MIN) to retrieve XXXX-00-00
    dates as the minimum allowed ODBC date (XXXX-01-01). Added another
    option (FLAG_MIN_DATE_TO_ZERO) to mirror this but for bound parameters.
    FLAG_MIN_DATE_TO_ZERO only changes 0000-01-01 to 0000-00-00. (Bug #13766)
  * Fixed possible crash if SQLBindCol() was not called before SQLSetPos().
    Fixed use of MYSQL structure pertaining to updating large blobs in
    cursors. (Bug #10562)

----

3.51.16 (14-Jun-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * Added support for using SSL. This is not yet exposed in the setup GUI,
    but must be enabled through configuration files or the DSN. (Bug #12918)

  Bugs fixed:
  * Statements that return multiple result sets (such as calls to stored
    procedures) would not free all results when closed. (Bug #27544)
  * SQL_C_TYPE_DATE, SQL_C_TYPE_TIME, and SQL_C_TYPE_TIMESTAMP were formatted
    without seperators, which could cause them to get interpreted incorrectly
    in some cases due to server bugs. (Bug #15773)
  * Calls to SQLNativeSql() could cause stack corruption due to an incorrect
    pointer cast. (Bug #28758)
  * SQLSetPos() could update or delete the wrong rows when the original result
    set did not contain all columns of a multi-part primary key. (Bug #28255)
  * SQLTables() did not distinguish tables from views. (Bug #23031)
  * The wrong function was used for freeing the artificial result sets that
    are created by some catalog functions. (Bug #22797)
  * Accessing the results of catalog functions could cause a crash when the
    "Don't cache results" option was set and a forward-only cursor was
    being used. (Bug #4657)
  * SQL_WVARCHAR and SQL_WLONGVARCHAR parameters were not properly quoted
    and escaped. (Bug #16235)
  * SQLForeignKeys() did not properly escape wildcard characters in its
    table name parameters when retrieving information. (Bug #27723)
  * Calls to SQLSetPos() could cause the driver to incorrectly calculate the
    length of some fields. (Bug #16917)

----

3.51.15 (04-May-2007)

  Bugs fixed:
  * SQLGetFunctions() reported that the driver supported SQLProcedureColumns(),
    even though it does not. (Bug #27591)
  * The row status array given to SQLExtendedFetch() was being stored
    as SQL_ATTR_ROW_STATUS_PTR, which could cause it to be used when it
    should not.
  * SQLSetPos() would not update a row unless all columns were bound,
    but it should only require that at least one column is bound and
    not set to be ignored.
  * SQLBulkOperations() and SQLSetPos() used the wrong indicator variable
    values when batch-inserting rows. (Bug #24306)
  * SQLGetConnectAttr() would report an incorrect isolation level if it
    was not explicitly set using SQLSetConnectAttr(). (Bug #27589)
  * The last argument of SQLColAttribute() and SQLColAttributes() was
    always being treated as a pointer to an SQLINTEGER even though it is
    sometimes a pointer to an SQLLEN.
  * SQLForeignKeys would return keys from the wrong tables due to improper
    handling of table names. (Bug #4518)
  * Changed the behavior of myodbc3i utility, so it loads the driver library
    prior to the setup library when creating a new DSN (Bug #27220)
  * SQLProcedures returned incomplete and incorrect information. (Bug #23033)
  * Statements that used "WHERE CURRENT OF" for positioned updates could
    not be re-executed or used with parameters that were provided using
    SQLPutData() and SQLParamData(). (Bug #5853)
  * SQLTransact() did not commit or rollback all transactions in the
    environment when no database connection was specified. (Bug #21588)
  * Updated use of FIELD_TYPE_* to MYSQL_TYPE_*, which has been preferred
    since the 3.23 days. (And FIELD_TYPE_* may finally disappear in 5.2.)

    explicitly specified using a call to SQLSetEnvAttr()
  * On 64-bit systems, some types would be incorrectly returned. (Bug #26024)
  * Using DataAdapter, Connector/ODBC may continually consume memory when
    reading the same records within a loop (Windows Server 2003 SP1/SP2 only).

    releases. (Bug #12393)
  * Some properties returned by SQLGetInfo() were set using the wrong data
    type, resulting in possible memory overruns. (Bug #20995)
