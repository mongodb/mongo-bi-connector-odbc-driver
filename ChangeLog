3.51.25 (11-Apr-2008)

  Bugs fixed:
  * SQL_DESC_FIXED_PREC_SCALE was possibly being reported as true, but it's
    never supported. (Bug #35581)
  * ADO failed to retrieve the length of LONGBLOB columns. (Bug #12805)

----

3.51.24 (14-Mar-2008)

  Bugs fixed:
  * ConfigDSN() returned FALSE when the dialog was cancelled by the user.
  * Static cursor was unable to be used through ADO when dynamic cursors
    were enabled. (Bug #27351)
  * Driver would crash when requesting the current catalog before connecting.
    (Bug #16653)
  * Catalog data was truncated due to NAME_LEN only allocating a single byte
    for characters. (Bug #32864)
  * SSL connections could not be established properly. Added the server
    certificate verification flag. (Bug #29955)
  * Added deprecated SQLSetParam function. (Bug #29871)
  * Recordset-based update fails if blob field is queried. (Bug #19065)
  * Allows dirty reading with SQL_TXN_READ_COMMITTED isolation through ODBC
    (Bug #31959)

    (Bug #32420)
  * SQLFetch or SQLFetchScroll returns negative data length using SQL_C_WCHAR.
    (Bug #31220)
  * An SQLSTATE of HY000 was returned when a stored procedure was not found,
    instead of 42000. This caused problems with ADO's adCmdUnknown option.
    (Bug #27158)
  * Identifiers were quoted incorrectly by SQLColumns(). (Bug #32989)
  * Worked around bug in iODBC installer library that made it impossible
    to create a system DSN, particularly on Mac OS X, where the installer
    created the /Library/ODBC/*.ini files with insufficient permissions.
    (Bug #31495)
  * Unresolved symbols "min" and "max" in libmyodbc3.so w/gcc 4.2. 
    (Bug #34256)
  * Fixed some incorrect information returned by SQLGetTypeInfo().
    (Bug #30918)
  * Values bound using the SQL_C_CHAR value type but with numeric
    parameter type were not correctly escaped. (Bug #34575)
  * The driver reported that it does not support SQLProcedureColumns(),
    which causes problems for ADO. (Bug #33298)

----

3.51.23 (9-Jan-2008)

  Bugs fixed:
  * Allowed connections to be enlisted in distributed transactions, even
    though the driver doesn't support them. (Bug #32727)
  * Cleaning up environment handles in multithread environments could result
    in a five (or more) second delay. (Bug #32366)
  * SQLAllocStmt() and SQLFreeStmt() did not synchronize access to the
    list of statements associated with a connection. (Bug #32857)
  * SQLGetInfo() returned the wrong value for SQL_DATABASE_NAME when no
    database was selected. (Bug #3780)
  * Changing the DSN name when editing a DSN left behind the DSN
    under the old name in addition to creating the new entry. (Bug #31165)

----

3.51.22 (13-Nov-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * Removed workaround for bug #10491 in the server, which has now been
    fixed in MySQL Server 5.0.48 and 5.1.21.
  * Added FLAG_COLUMN_SIZE_S32 to limit the reported column size to a
    signed 32-bit integer. This option is automatically enabled for ADO
    applications, in order to work around a bug in ADO. (Bug #13776)

  Bugs fixed:
  * SQLGetInfo() reported that UNION was not supported. (Bug #32253)
  * The non-portable "English" locale was used for handling of decimal
    and floating-point values instead of "C". (Bug #32294)
  * Unsigned integer values greater than the maximum value of a signed
    integer were handled incorrectly. (Bug #32171)
  * The wrong result was returned by SQLGetData() when the data was an
    empty string and a zero-sized buffer was specified. (Bug #30958)

----

3.51.21 (5-Oct-2007)

  Bugs fixed:
  * The wrong value was returned for SQL_DESC_LITERAL_PREFIX and
    SQL_DESC_LITERAL_SUFFIX for date-time fields. (Bug #31009)
  * The wrong SQLSTATE was reported when the connection to the server
    was lost. (Bug #3456)
  * SQLDescribeCol() incorrectly reported whether auto-increment and
    some timestamp fields were nullable. (Bug #26108)
  * SQLGetTypeInfo() reported the wrong column size for the SQL_TYPE_TIME
    type. (Bug #30939)
  * Empty selection for database and character set comboboxes in setup
    were set to " " instead of an empty string. (Bug #30568)
  * Fixed incorrect input requirement in the setup dialog. (Bug #30499)
  * Added SQLSetParam function and fixed handling of buffer length in
    SQLBindParameter. (Bug #29871)

    columns without bound data buffers. (Bug #31246)

----

3.51.20 (7-Sep-2007)

  Bugs fixed:
  * The FLAG_NO_PROMPT option was not handled by SQLDriverConnect().
    (Bug #30840)
  * Removed checkbox in setup dialog for FLAG_FIELD_LENGTH ("Don't
    Optimize Column Width"), which was removed from the driver in 3.51.18.
  * The wrong column size was returned for binary data. (Bug #30547)
  * The specified length of the username and authentication parameters to
    SQLConnect() were not being honored. (Bug #30774)
  * SQLGetData() will now always return SQL_NO_DATA_FOUND on second call
    when no data left, even if requested size is 0. (Bug#30520)
  * SQLSetParam() caused memory allocation errors due to driver manager's 
    mapping of deprecated functions (buffer length -1). (Bug#29871)
  * SQLGetConnectAttr() did not reflect the connection state correctly.
    (Bug#14639)

----

3.51.19 (8-Aug-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * Because of Bug #10491 in the server, character string results were
    sometimes incorrectly identified as SQL_VARBINARY. Until this server
    bug is corrected, the driver will identify all variable-length
    strings as SQL_VARCHAR.

----

3.51.18 (6-Aug-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * An experimental binary package, without an installer, is available
    for Microsoft Windows x64 Edition.
  * Binary packages as disk images with installers are now available
    for Mac OS X.
  * Binary packages for Sun Solaris are available as PKG packages.
  * Added FLAG_MULTI_STATEMENTS to allow issuing queries that contain
    multiple statements. Also added to the setup GUI. (Bug #7445)
  * Removed support for the TRACE and TRACEFILE DSN options. The standard
    ODBC logging should be used.
  * Added support for SQL_ATTR_ROW_BIND_OFFSET_PTR in normal cursors.
    (Bug #6741)
  * Added SSL options to the GUI setup dialog.

  Bugs fixed:
  * SQLColumns() incorrectly reported that an auto-incrementing
    field was not nullable. (Bug #14407)
  * SQLColumns() incorrectly reported that an auto-updating timestamp
    field was not nullable. (Bug #14414)
  * Lengths returned by SQLColumns(), SQLDescribeCol(), and SQLColAttribute()
    were often incorrect. These lengths should now conform to the ODBC
    specification. FLAG_FIELD_LENGTH no longer has any effect. The default
    behavior was incorrect. (Bug #27862)
  * The SQL_DATA_TYPE column in SQLColumns() results did not report the
    correct value for date and time types.
  * The SQL_DATETIME_SUB column in SQLColumns() was not correctly set for
    date and time types.
  * The value for SQL_DESC_FIXED_PREC_SCALE was not returned correctly
    for decimal values in MySQL 5.0 and later.
  * The wrong value from SQL_DESC_LITERAL_SUFFIX was returned for binary
    fields.
  * The wrong value for SQL_DESC_TYPE was returned for date and time types.
  * The wrong value for DECIMAL_DIGITS in SQLColumns() was reported for
    FLOAT and DOUBLE fields, as well as the wrong value for the scale
    parameter to SQLDescribeCol(), and the SQL_DESC_SCALE attribute
    from SQLColAttribute().
  * MySQL BIT(n) fields were always treated as SQL_BIT data. When n > 1,
    they are now treated as binary data.
  * If the connection character set was set to a multibyte character set,
    such as UTF-8, the wrong column size was reported. (Bug #19345)
  * SQLSpecialColumns() returned all TIMESTAMP fields when queried for
    SQL_ROWVER, not just an auto-updating TIMESTAMP field. (Bug #9927, still
    limited by Bug #30081 in the server.)
  * SQLConnect() and SQLDriverConnect() were rewritten to eliminate duplicate
    code and ensure all options were supported using both connection methods.
    SQLDriverConnect() now only requires the setup library to be present when
    the call requires it.
  * SQLColumns() failed when a catalog was specified due to an
    incorrectly-generated query. (Bug #29888)
  * SQLGetTypeInfo() returned incorrect information for date and time
    fields, and would not return results when queried for the SQL_DATETIME
    type. (Bug #28657)
  * myodbc3i did not honor the 's' and 'u' modifier to the -d option for
    installing the driver as a system or user driver. (Bug #29964)
  * Tables from the mysql database (catalog) were listed as SYSTEM TABLES
    by SQLTables() even when a different catalog was being queried. This
    also introduced errors due to the fix for Bug #26934.  (Bug #28662)

----

3.51.17 (13-Jul-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * The setup library has been split into its own RPM package, to allow
    installing the driver itself with no GUI dependencies.
  * Added an option (CHARSET) for specifying the default character
    set for a connection. This must be used instead of a "SET NAMES"
    statement. Also available from the GUI setup dialog. (Related
    to Bug #6667 and Bug #9498.)
  * Dis-allow NULL ptr for null indicator when calling SQLGetData()
    if value is null. Now returns SQL_ERROR w/state 22002.
  * Fixed calling convention ptr and wrong free in myodbc3i, and fixed
    the null terminating (was only one, not two) when writing DSN to string.

  Bugs fixed:
  * myodbc3i did not correctly format driver info, which could cause the
    installation to fail. (Bug #29709)
  * Multiple result sets were not correctly flushed when a statement
    handle was closed. (Bug #16817)
  * SQLProcedures() did not handle NULL parameters, which could lead to 
    crashes (Bug #28316) 
  * SQLColumns() did not handle many of its parameters correctly, which
    could lead to incorrect results. The table name argument was not handled
    as a pattern value, and most arguments were not escaped correctly when
    they contained non-alphanumeric characters. (Bug #8860)
  * If there was more than one unique key on a table, the correct fields
    were not used in handling SQLSetPos(). (Bug #10563)
  * SQLColAttribute() returned the wrong value for SQL_DESC_BASE_COLUMN_NAME
    and SQL_DESC_BASE_TABLE_NAME for aliased fields. (Bug #6197)
  * Calling SQLGetDiagField with RecNumber 0,DiagIdentifier
    NOT 0 returns SQL_ERROR (Bug #16224)
  * Correctly return error if SQLBindCol is called with an invalid column
  * Fixed error handling of OOM and bad connections in catalog functions.
    This might raise errors in code paths that had not seen them in the past.
    Gathered the logic for internal result sets into one place. (Bug #26934)
  * Fixed bad use of memory related to setup/util/GUI. (Bug #27315)
  * Added a new DSN "OPTION" (FLAG_ZERO_DATE_TO_MIN) to retrieve XXXX-00-00
    dates as the minimum allowed ODBC date (XXXX-01-01). Added another
    option (FLAG_MIN_DATE_TO_ZERO) to mirror this but for bound parameters.
    FLAG_MIN_DATE_TO_ZERO only changes 0000-01-01 to 0000-00-00. (Bug #13766)
  * Fixed possible crash if SQLBindCol() was not called before SQLSetPos().
    Fixed use of MYSQL structure pertaining to updating large blobs in
    cursors. (Bug #10562)

----

3.51.16 (14-Jun-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * Added support for using SSL. This is not yet exposed in the setup GUI,
    but must be enabled through configuration files or the DSN. (Bug #12918)

  Bugs fixed:
  * Statements that return multiple result sets (such as calls to stored
    procedures) would not free all results when closed. (Bug #27544)
  * SQL_C_TYPE_DATE, SQL_C_TYPE_TIME, and SQL_C_TYPE_TIMESTAMP were formatted
    without seperators, which could cause them to get interpreted incorrectly
    in some cases due to server bugs. (Bug #15773)
  * Calls to SQLNativeSql() could cause stack corruption due to an incorrect
    pointer cast. (Bug #28758)
  * SQLSetPos() could update or delete the wrong rows when the original result
    set did not contain all columns of a multi-part primary key. (Bug #28255)
  * SQLTables() did not distinguish tables from views. (Bug #23031)
  * The wrong function was used for freeing the artificial result sets that
    are created by some catalog functions. (Bug #22797)
  * Accessing the results of catalog functions could cause a crash when the
    "Don't cache results" option was set and a forward-only cursor was
    being used. (Bug #4657)
  * SQL_WVARCHAR and SQL_WLONGVARCHAR parameters were not properly quoted
    and escaped. (Bug #16235)
  * SQLForeignKeys() did not properly escape wildcard characters in its
    table name parameters when retrieving information. (Bug #27723)
  * Calls to SQLSetPos() could cause the driver to incorrectly calculate the
    length of some fields. (Bug #16917)

----

3.51.15 (04-May-2007)

  Bugs fixed:
  * SQLGetFunctions() reported that the driver supported SQLProcedureColumns(),
    even though it does not. (Bug #27591)
  * The row status array given to SQLExtendedFetch() was being stored
    as SQL_ATTR_ROW_STATUS_PTR, which could cause it to be used when it
    should not.
  * SQLSetPos() would not update a row unless all columns were bound,
    but it should only require that at least one column is bound and
    not set to be ignored.
  * SQLBulkOperations() and SQLSetPos() used the wrong indicator variable
    values when batch-inserting rows. (Bug #24306)
  * SQLGetConnectAttr() would report an incorrect isolation level if it
    was not explicitly set using SQLSetConnectAttr(). (Bug #27589)
  * The last argument of SQLColAttribute() and SQLColAttributes() was
    always being treated as a pointer to an SQLINTEGER even though it is
    sometimes a pointer to an SQLLEN.
  * SQLForeignKeys would return keys from the wrong tables due to improper
    handling of table names. (Bug #4518)
  * Changed the behavior of myodbc3i utility, so it loads the driver library
    prior to the setup library when creating a new DSN (Bug #27220)
  * SQLProcedures returned incomplete and incorrect information. (Bug #23033)
  * Statements that used "WHERE CURRENT OF" for positioned updates could
    not be re-executed or used with parameters that were provided using
    SQLPutData() and SQLParamData(). (Bug #5853)
  * SQLTransact() did not commit or rollback all transactions in the
    environment when no database connection was specified. (Bug #21588)
  * Updated use of FIELD_TYPE_* to MYSQL_TYPE_*, which has been preferred
    since the 3.23 days. (And FIELD_TYPE_* may finally disappear in 5.2.)

----

3.51.14 (08-Mar-2007)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * Added auto-reconnect option because automatic reconnect is now
    disabled by default in libmysql
  * Added auto is null option (Bug #10910)
  * Added support for SQLMoreResults
  * Checking SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_DEAD now always calls mysql_ping() to
    check for a dead connection.
  * Remove ODBC escape syntax { and } that begin and terminate statements,
    allowing {CALL (?)} for procedures that don't require OUT or INOUT
    parameters
  * Improved regression tests
  * Added --with-separate-debug-driver ./configure option

  Bugs fixed:
  * SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT was inappropriately mapped to
    MYSQL_OPT_CONNECT_TIMEOUT. (Bug #19823)

    due to an uninitialized variable. (Bug #16535)
  * Fix positioned update and delete on statements derived from one
    table with no primary key but including all columns (Bug #22796)
  * Only initialize the ODBC version when the old-style SQLAllocEnv()
    is called. If SQLAllocHandle() is used, the ODBC version must be
    explicitly specified using a call to SQLSetEnvAttr()
  * On 64-bit systems, some types would be incorrectly returned. (Bug #26024) 
  * Using DataAdapter, Connector/ODBC may continually consume memory when
    reading the same records within a loop (Windows Server 2003 SP1/SP2 only).
    (Bug #20459)
  * Fix truncation of queries with leading spaces when SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS
    is set to a non-zero value (Bug #6609)
  * Fixed problem with memory allocation in Windows for BLOB and long
    queries that need re-allocation of net->buff
  * Using Connector/ODBC, with SQLBindCol and binding the length to the return
    value from SQL_LEN_DATA_AT_EXEC fails with a memory allocation error.

  * Fixed field lengths reported by SQLDescribeCol() when using functions
    such as COMPRESS() in SELECT queries (Bug #20208)
  * Fixed 64-bit issues related to SQLINTEGER columns defined as int,
    but later cast to long.
  * TIME fields were incorrectly converted into date/time values. (Bug #25846,
    Bug #24867, and Bug #25432)
  * Fixed #Deleted issue in Microsoft Access by changing the default behavior
    of MyODBC driver regarding SQL_AUTO_IS_NULL variable. Added new option to
    the GUI and driver
  * Fixed memory leak in SQLSpecialColumns()
  * Corrected return size of SQLGetStmtAttr() when getting desc handles
  * Fixed SQLGetInfo() of SQL_TXN_CAPABLE to return SQL_TC_DDL_COMMIT
  * For SQL_C_TIME, handle conversion from the different time-related MySQL
    types, instead of always assuming it is just a TIME. (DATETIME, TIMESTAMP,
    and DATE were all handled incorrectly.)
  * Fix crash when default database is not set
  * Fix handling of lost connections (Bug #14639)
  * File DSNs could not be saved. (Bug #12019)
  * Nullability of auto_increment fields is incorrect. (Bug #10130)

    releases. (Bug #12393)
  * Some properties returned by SQLGetInfo() were set using the wrong data
    type, resulting in possible memory overruns. (Bug #20995)
  * Ending a transaction using SQLEndTran() on a environment handle was
    not supported. (Bug #21588)

3.51.02 (05-Mar-2002)

  Functionality added or changed:
  * Added support for SQLTablePrivileges() and SQLColumnPrivileges()
   
  Bugs fixed:
  * Fixed SQLDriverConnect() to return  correct output string. This is
    the main fix for 'Reserved error (-7778)' from all Windows ODBC
    applications.
  * Fixed SQLError() to clear the error buffers on the first call when
    the ODBC version is SQL_OV_ODBC3, so subsequent calls will return
    SQL_NO_DATA.
  * Fixed SQL_UPDATE and SQL_ADD from SQLSetPos().
  * Fixed SQLSetPos() and SQLBulkOperations() to handle when the 
    application passes SQL_NTS as pcbValue
  * Fixed SQLColumns() to return the correct Nullability
  * Fixed SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_DEAD. This should fix the issues from
    SQLExpress for XBase++ and .NET connection closed issues
  * Fixed SQLGetTypeInfo() to return correct values for SQL_DATE, 
    SQL_TYPE_DATE, SQL_TIME, SQL_TYPE_TIME, SQL_TIMESTAMP, and
    SQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP.
  * Fixed tab ordering from DSN configuration dialog
  * Added default values for new DSN creation
  * Fixed export of tables from Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft DTS
    when one of the field types are TEXT or VARCHAR

    values based on the ODBC version
  * Enhanced cursor handling
  * Changed SQLGetTypeInfo() to return column headers as per ODBC 3.50
    specification
  * Changed all catalog functions to return column headers as per ODBC 3.50
    specification

    that DSN settings can be tested while configuring
  * Added 'Help' button to the DSN setup dialog
  * Added SOCKET option to the SQLConnect() interface
  * Added support for the deprecated SQLParamOptions() function so one
    can specify batch parameter processing with ODBC 2.x applications
  * Added server name and version to the statement error prefix
  * Added FILEDSN support
   
  Bugs fixed:
  * Fixed SQL_FETCH_RELATIVE from SQLExtendedFetch() or SQLFetchScroll() to
    handle the following cases:
    - BeforeStart AND FetchOffset <= 0
    - CurrRowsetStart = 1 AND FetchOffset < 0
    - CurrRowsetStart > 1 AND 
      CurrRowsetStart + FetchOffset < 1 AND
      |FetchOffset| > RowsetSize
    - CurrRowsetStart > 1 AND 
      CurrRowsetStart + FetchOffset < 1 AND
      |FetchOffset| <= RowsetSize         
   * Fixed SQL_FETCH_RELATIVE from SQLExtendedFetch() or SQLFetchScroll()
     to handle the case when:
     - FetchOffset  < 0 AND
       |FetchOffset| > LastResultRow AND
       |FetchOffset| > RowsetSize    
   * Fixed memory leaks when linked against iODBC or unixODBC
